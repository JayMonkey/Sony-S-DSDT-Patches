Sony Vaio-S DSDT Patches
========================

I am currently working on a series of DSDT patches for use with MaciASL (or anther DSDT editor). However I recommend using ReHabMan's fork of MaciASL available for download here :-

https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-MaciASL-patchmatic

These patches will allow for clean running of OSX Mavericks on a Sony VPC-SE2C5E Laptop, However most of the patches will be generic for all Sony Vaio S series laptops (SA/SB/SC). Certain patches will require specific variants for items such as the display resolution and support for the Sony Sheet battery option. 

IMPORTANT - I do not recommend anybody using my Sony patches right now as they are still undergoing testing and development.
I will update this Readme once the patches are ready for public use.

For full instructions on how to install OSX Mavericks on Sony Vaio VPCSE2C5E laptop and a pre-patched DSDT please see my guide at TonyMacx86:-

I will be publishing a new guide on how to extract your native DSDT and patch it using these repositoryâ€™s soon.

Cheers
