Sony-S-DSDT-Patches
===================

I am currentley working on a series of DSDT patches for use with MaciASL
I recomend using ReHabMan's version available for download here :-

https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-MaciASL-patchmatic

These patches will allow for clean running of OSX Mavericks on VPC-SE25CE

Still in Development
