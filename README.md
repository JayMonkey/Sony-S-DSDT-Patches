Sony Vaio-S DSDT Patches
========================

I am currently working on a series of DSDT patches for use with MaciASL (or anther DSDT editor). However I recommend using ReHabMan's fork of MaciASL available for download here :-

https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-MaciASL-patchmatic

These patches will allow for clean running of OSX Mavericks on a Sony VPC-SE2C5E Laptop, However most of the patches will be generic for all Sony Vaio S series laptops (SA/SB/SC). Certain patches will require specific variants for items such as the display resolution and support for the Sony Sheet battery option. 

To use these patches add the following repo info into MaciASL:-

http://raw.github.com/JayMonkey/Sony-S-DSDT-Patches/master

In addition to my DSDT patches you will also need to use ReHabMans Generic DSDT patches by also adding his repo to MaciASL:-

http://raw.github.com/RehabMan/Laptop-DSDT-Patch/master

IMPORTANT - I do not recommend anybody using my Sony patches right now as they are still undergoing testing and development.
I will update this Readme once the patches are ready for public use.

For full instructions on how to install OSX Mavericks on Sony Vaio VPCSE2C5E laptop and a pre-patched DSDT please see my guide at TonyMacx86:-

I will be publishing a new guide on how to extract your native DSDT and patch it using these repositoryâ€™s soon.

Cheers
