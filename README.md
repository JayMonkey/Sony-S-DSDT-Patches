Sony-S-DSDT-Patches
===================

I am currentley working on a series of DSDT patches for use with MaciASL. I recomend using ReHabMan's fork of MaciASL available for download here :-

https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-MaciASL-patchmatic

These patches will allow for clean running of OSX Mavericks on a Sony VPC-SE25CE Laptop, However most of the patches will be generic for all Sony Vaio S series laptops (SA/SB/SC). Certain patches will require specific varients for items such as the display resolution.

To use these patches add th efollowing repo info into MaciASL:-

http://raw.github.com/JayMonkey/Sony-S-DSDT-Patches/tree/master

I do not recomend anybody using these patches as they are still underging testing and development.
I will update this read once the patches are ready for public use.

Cheers
Jay
