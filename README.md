Sony-S-DSDT-Patches
===================

I am currentley working on a series of DSDT patches for use with MaciASL (or anther DSDT editor). However I recomend using ReHabMan's fork of MaciASL available for download here :-

https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-MaciASL-patchmatic

These patches will allow for clean running of OSX Mavericks on a Sony VPC-SE2C5E Laptop, However most of the patches will be generic for all Sony Vaio S series laptops (SA/SB/SC). Certain patches will require specific varients for items such as the display resolution.

To use these patches add the following repo info into MaciASL:-

http://raw.github.com/JayMonkey/Sony-S-DSDT-Patches/tree/master

In addition to my DSDT paches you wil also need to use ReHabMans Generic DSDT paches by also adding his repo to MaciASL:-

http://raw.github.com/RehabMan/Laptop-DSDT-Patch/master

I do not recomend anybody using my Sony patches right now as they are still underging testing and development.
I will update this ReadMe once the patches are ready for public use.

For full instructions on how to install OSX on Sony Vaio VPCSE2C5E and pre patched DSDT please see my guide at TonyMacx86:-
